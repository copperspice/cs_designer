## Designer

### Introduction

CS Designer is a cross platform stand alone program which developers can use to graphically create or edit
User Interface files. It was developed using the CopperSpice libraries and was written in C++.


### Building

To build CS Designer from source a current copy of the CopperSpice libraries, a C++17 compiler, and a C++17 standard
library are required. Designer uses the following CopperSpice libraries: CsCore, CsGui, CsNetwork, and CsXml.

To run Designer multiple plugins must be copied to the deploy folder. This will occur automatically when the
project is installed.


|Plugin   |Location   |
|---------|-----------|
|platform      |"your_path/designer/platforms"     |
|              |                                   |
|printer driver|"your_path/designer/printerdrivers"|
